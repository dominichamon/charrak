# Charrak

Charrak was an unfortunate Kobold that stumbled upon a group of adventurers
during a series of encounters which were part of the larger history of the
http://www.drinkinganddragons.org crew, but have yet to be fully written down.

He wore a bucket on his head.

He developed crushes on various party members.  Usually for pay.

Charrak the IRC chatbot is a manifestation of Charrak. But he's so much more
of an asshole than the orignal.

He also lives on Twitter: https://twitter.com/therealcharrak
