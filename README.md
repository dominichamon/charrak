# Charrak

Charrak was a misfortunate Kobold the stumbled upon a group of adventurers during an encounter that is in the annals of the http://www.drinkinganddragons.org crew but have yet to be fully written down.

He work a bucket on his head.

He developed crushes on various party members.

Charrak the IRC chatbot is a manifestation of Charrak. But he's so much more of an asshole than the orignal.

He also lives on Twitter: https://twitter.com/therealcharrak
